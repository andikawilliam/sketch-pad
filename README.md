# Sketch Pad

This project is an exercise to learn the basics of event listeners and DOM manipulation using Javascript.
The html file is empty, with all content being generated purely using Javascript. 

### Goal
> Create a webpage with 16x16 grid of squares.  
> Every time the cursor hovers over a square, change its color.

#### Added features
1. Add button to reset color instead of refreshing the page
2. Add button to change the size of the grid
3. Added left click and right click listener to turn on/off hover color
